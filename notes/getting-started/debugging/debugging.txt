Debugging has us return to our tsconfig.json file.

Steps to debug:
    We must uncomment the sourceMap line/feature under the Emit section.

    Sourcemap shows us how each line in our Typescript code maps to the Javascript code. This is not human-readable. It is for the debugger.

    Click debug option in VSCode > Create launch.json.

    Add a new option "preLaunchTask", inside the configurations object, and set it to text: "tsc: build - tsconfig.json".

Note:

    You MUST uncomment sourceMap in the tsconfig.json file, because Node cannot debug the typescript file.
    
    sourceMap creates a Javascript file for Node.js to do debugging.
